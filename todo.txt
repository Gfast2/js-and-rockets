/ done
/ read again, try around with some feeling searching (1h 5m, got some feeling, start to know what I need, filter results that happened in 2018)
/ filter out result's belonge to NASA (20m)
/ sort the result with two critian (40m)
/ Figure out how to render the result onto screen (40m)
/ filter out attributs that need to be displaied on screen (5m)
/ Clean up ESLint config for modules with JSX (15m)
/ Add small type checking for react component

--- some importancy from README
/ making sure the provided tests are green.
/ Push your solution to a private repo in your personal Github account.

--- own notes
/ It's array of objects
/ each object is one "flight"
/ flight_number, mission_name and launch_date_unix can be found in each object's root attribute
/ payloads_count can be found in nested attribute rocket.second_stage.payloads_count
/ Result rockets have to be NASA's, this can be found rocket.second_stage.payloads (array), and in each object's attribute customers (array) can find this
/ result list critian:
  - lauches in 2018                         €€
  - a (one) payload that belonged to NASA   €€
  - inverse chronological order             €€
  - order with exception that those that carried more payloads should appear first €€
/ The render function will call prepareData eventually to draw the thing
